# Port Sort

For input `[4, 1, 6]` start a server listening on ports `base+4`, `base+1`, and `base+6`.

Attempt to connect to ports `base..base+âˆž`, in order, until given a termination signal. Add each successful connection to a list.

# Why?

Because the world needs [another](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bogosort) [dumb](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowsort) [sorting](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithms/Sleep_sort) [algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stooge_sort).

_"Port Sort"_ is also fun to say.

# Should ever I actually use this?

No
